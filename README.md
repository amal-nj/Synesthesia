# Synesthesia
Timbre transfer and Music visualization | AI Artathon

## ARTWORK NAME : SYNESTHESIA
## SUBMITTED BY : LITERALLY SEE

 
### Project Description :
Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which information meant to stimulate one of your senses stimulates several of them instead. It affects approx. 4% of the population but aspiring musicians are 7 times more likely to have it. We want music to reach hard of hearing people and have the maximum effect on their feelings. Our starting project generates active visuals based on recorded audios, the audience can literally see the sensation of music and not just feel it. 
We hope that our project can help those with hearing loss to feel nothing but the good vibrations only.

### Project AI Description :
MP3 files - whether sung or serenaded by instruments - are encoded into an array of musical notes which are used to generate visually audio-responsive images. The images are sourced from ImageNet classes, which contain 1000 common items, creatures, or objects. The current selection of images is done at random, but it can be specified using certain function arguments and flags. We do intend to make the feelings of the music corresponds and tell a holistically accurate story. Our outline is: to translate notes into feelings into relevant pictures, to make emotionally-charged art.

MP3 files - whether sang or played by instruments - are transferred into musical notes which are used to generate images. Afterwards, these images
The project uses three models. 
1- Timbre transfer with Magenta ddsp: takes an audio file, a choice of instrument and produces a new version of the input audio played with the chosen instrument. 
2- Deep visualizer: a music visualizer that takes the output file of the timbre transfer model and produces music visualization based on pitch, a number of chosen classes, and a few other parameters.
3- Style transfer: To further process the produced video. Style transfer is applied on every frame in the video separately. Eventually, all frames are compiled together with the audio from the first model.

### Project Art Description :
Imagine that while singing or playing your instrument, notes appear in front of people as changing elements and colors, and your emotions through music reaches to them in the maximum percentage.
