Timbre transfer and Music visualization | AI Artathon

## ARTWORK NAME : SYNESTHESIA
## SUBMITTED BY : LITERALLY SEE

 
### Project Description :
Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which information meant to stimulate one of your senses stimulates several of them instead. Aspiring musicians want for their music to reach people and have the maximum effect on their feelings. Our goal project is to generate active visuals based on real-time edited music, audience can literally see the sensation of music and not just feel it. We hope that our project can help people with hearing loss to feel the music even if they can't hear it.
### Project AI Description :
MP3 files - whether sang or played by instruments - are transferred into musical notes which are used to generate images. Afterwards, these images
The project uses three models. 
1- Timbre transfer with Magenta ddsp: takes an audio file, a choice of instrument and produces a new version of the input audio played with the chosen instrument. 
2- Deep visualizer: a music visualizer that takes the output file of the timbre transfer model and produces music visualization based on pitch, a number of chosen classes, and a few other parameters.
3- Style transfer: To further process the produced video. Style transfer is applied on every frame in the video separately. Eventually, all frames are compiled together with the audio from the first model.

### Project Art Description :
Imagine that while singing or playing your instrument, notes appear in front of people as changing elements and colors, and your emotions through music reaches to them in the maximum percentage.
